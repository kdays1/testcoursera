    <ol>
        <li><a href="./CSS_HTML_JS/site/index.html">Responsive Site</a>
            <p>This page is meant to be responsive, if the width is reduced, its content is going to wrap into different columns and rows.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="./CSS_HTML_JS/module3/index.html">Poly Restaurant</a>
            <p>This page simulates a Restaurant Page that is responsive, when the width is reduced, the menu turns into a drop-down menu and the logo disappears.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="./CSS_HTML_JS/module4/harder/index.html">Hello/Goodbye JS</a>
            <p>This page was the first approach to JS. In the console, there are some names and whenever the name begans with a "J" it should print "Googbye 'J'(name)", else, it should print "Hello (name)".</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="./CSS_HTML_JS/module5/assignment5-solution-starter/index.html">David Chu's China Bistro (Random Specials)</a>
            <p>Using the template home page seen in the course, in the "Specials Menu" we had to choose a random menu and display it when the tile for specials was clicked.</p>
